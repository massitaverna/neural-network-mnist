# neural-network-mnist
A neural network for recognizing hand-written digits from the MNIST database.

This is a self-learning project on the fundamentals of neural networks.

## Goal
The goal is to implement a neural network from scratch without any auxiliary library for AI. In particular, the focus is on the implementation of:
- Initialization of a neural network with variable number of neurons and layers
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Parametrization of the learning rate, number of epochs and mini-bacth size
- Backpropagation

## Disclaimer
Code is in Python, and aims to be simple: it's for educational purposes!
